<h1>My Favourites Movies of all time</h1>
<h2>Top three movies that I would like to share</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Space Between Us</h3>

<p>It is a 2017 film but I watched it recently. It is about a boy who is born in Mars. His mother is 
a scientist who is the only lady among all the scientists travelling to Mars. This boy comes to Earth 
but has a disease that does not allow him to explore the Earth freely. His main goal is to find his father.
He falls in love with the girl who helps him to find his father. At the end he finds his father.
The movies ends by showing both the father and son in Mars and his girlfriend training in Earth to go to Mars.</p>

<p>If your a looking for a good science fiction along with a good romance which also has humour then I highly recommend 
this movie.</p>

<h3>Love O2O</h3>

<p>It is a chinese drama. The main characters are computer majors and that is one main reason why I love that drama.
If your looking for a good office romance story along with humour you can watch this. If your looking for breakups and 
emotional scenes then this series may not impress you that much. It is a pleasant love story between two people who 
understand each other so much. They have no fights, no misunderstandings and such.</p>

<h3>Sita Ramam</h3>

<p>It is a tamil movie. This also a love story but mostly tells us about patriotism for one's country and love for all 
countries across the world. Not only that, but it also tell us about how the royalty and commoners were differentiated 
during those times in India. It also shows how the people in India are so concerned about religion that they forget 
they are humans in the first place. The hero is a Indian soldier while the heroine is a muslim princess. The movie also shows 
various characters who betray, who change for the better, characters that support the lead characters and so on.</p>

<p>If your looking for a family entertainer, patriotic, romantic and an emotional movie, don't miss this one.</p>
